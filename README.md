# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
After the school board looked at the data, they noticed that there was some academic dishonesty. The school board noticed that for Thomas High School, the ninth graders had altered data for specifically reading and math grades. Maria and her surpervisor reached out to have the math and reading scores for Thomas High School be replaced with NaNs. After the scores are replaced, repeat the school district analysis.
